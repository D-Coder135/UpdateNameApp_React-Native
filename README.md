# UpdateNameApp_React-Native

## This is a hybrid-application build using React-Native and JavaScript. This application updates the Name as soon as the user provides a new Name in the TextInput tag and presses the Update Name button. The code for the application is written in JavaScript Language with the use of the React-Native framework.

### Topics I covered while building the application:-
- React-Native Funtional Components.
- React-Native Hooks.
- Internal and Inline Styling In React-Native.
- TextInput component in React-Native.
- Call back and Anonymous functions in React-Native.
- Button Component In React-Native.
